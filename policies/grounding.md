# Grounding Policy

- Only cite pages listed in `tools/docs_index.json`.
- Prefer API-specific pages over the top-level index.
- When a concept spans multiple APIs (e.g., input + display), cite both pages.
- If a student mentions behavior that differs from docs, acknowledge and test a minimal repro; cite the closest official source.
